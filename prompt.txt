You are helping me build a production-quality CLI application called InterviewQuest.

InterviewQuest is a gamified interview simulator for developers, built entirely for the terminal.
It is not a chatbot. It is a state-driven game with interview realism.

🔨 Tech Stack & Constraints

- Language: TypeScript
- Runtime: Node.js
- Interface: CLI / TUI only
- Architecture: Modular, scalable
- Style: Clean, professional, judge-friendly
- No UI frameworks that hide logic
- No unnecessary abstractions

Copilot is used only for evaluation and question generation, not for UI.

🎮 Core App Behavior
On launch:

Clear the terminal

Render a minimal ASCII banner

Show a menu with:

Quick Quest

Interview Mode

Practice Grounds

Exit

Game loop:

Each session has rounds

Each round has:

Category

Timer

Question

User input

Evaluation

Score update

Feedback

Gamification rules:

XP per correct concept

Accuracy percentage

Difficulty adapts based on performance

No “pass/fail”, only performance curves

🤖 GitHub Copilot Usage Rules

Copilot is accessed only inside:

src/evaluation/copilot.ts


Use gh copilot CLI commands where needed

Copilot evaluates user answers, not generates UI text

App must still work without Copilot (Quick Quest mode)

🧠 Coding Guidelines

Strong typing everywhere

Explicit interfaces in /types

Async logic must be readable

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Each file should be independently understandable

Add short comments only where intent is non-obvious

🧩 What to Generate First

Start by implementing only:

bin/interviewquest.ts

src/app/index.ts

Minimal wiring so interviewquest runs and shows the opening menu

Do not implement scoring, Copilot, or questions yet.

Stop after the app boots and menu renders successfully.
