🚀 Excited to share InterviewQuest - A Gamified Terminal Interview Simulator!

After countless hours of preparation, I've built a tool that makes practicing coding interviews actually fun.

What is it?
InterviewQuest is a CLI application that helps developers practice technical interviews through a gamified experience - right in your terminal!

Key Features:
🎯 Guess the Output mode with code snippets
💝 Lives system (start with 3 hearts)
🔥 Streak bonuses for consecutive correct answers
📊 Score tracking and adaptive difficulty
🎨 Beautiful, centered terminal UI
🤖 Optional AI evaluation with GitHub Copilot

Why I built this:
Traditional interview prep can be boring and intimidating. I wanted to create something that:
- Makes practice engaging
- Provides instant feedback
- Adapts to your skill level
- Works entirely in the terminal (developers' natural habitat!)

Tech Stack:
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Custom terminal wrapper
- Minimal dependencies (only 3!)

The app is open-source and ready to use! Check it out:

I built InterviewQuest - A terminal-based interview prep game with lives and streaks
```

### Body
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I just finished building **InterviewQuest** - a gamified CLI tool for practicing coding interviews.

## What is it?

It's a terminal application that turns interview practice into a game. You get code snippets, predict the output, and earn points while managing lives (3 hearts).

## Why?

Let's be honest - interview prep can be boring. I wanted something that:
- Makes practice actually fun
- Lives entirely in the terminal
- Provides instant feedback
- Adapts to your skill level

## Features

- 🎯 **Guess the Output** mode (main game)
- 💝 **Lives system** - lose a heart on wrong answers
- 🔥 **Streak bonuses** - 3 in a row levels up difficulty
- 📊 **Score tracking** with accuracy stats
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - centered, colorful terminal interface
- 🤖 **AI evaluation** - optional GitHub Copilot integration

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Only 3 dependencies (chalk, figlet, @types/node)
- Custom terminal wrapper
- ~70KB package size

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anupamthakur-dev/interview-quest.git
cd interview-quest
npm install && npm run build

# Run with built-in questions
npm start

# Or with AI features
npm run start:ai
```

## Smart AI Configuration

- **Local dev:** AI disabled by default (use `--ai` flag)
- **Production:** AI enabled by default (full experience)

## What's Next?

Planning to add:
- Interview mode with timed challenges
- Practice grounds (unlimited, no pressure)
- More question categories
- Session persistence
- Leaderboard

Would love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?
